# **Chrome Extension Name**: SlangScope

## Core Features:

- Slang Identification: AI-powered slang recognition to detect slang terms within the active web page's text using the Gemini API. It will also use reasoning about context to avoid flagging innocent text as slang.
- Slang Highlighting: Underline recognized slang terms on the webpage for easy visual identification.
- Slang Information Display: Pop-up window providing the Definition, Country of Origin and the Estimated Age Range of the slang, using Gemini as a tool.
- Customization Options: Toggle to enable/disable slang detection for the current tab, and options to select the underlining color.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#A020F0) to evoke a modern and intelligent feel, while remaining playful and approachable.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to purple but almost entirely desaturated, for a clean and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF), an analogous color, used for interactive elements to draw attention, while remaining playful
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a clean and modern appearance for optimal readability.
